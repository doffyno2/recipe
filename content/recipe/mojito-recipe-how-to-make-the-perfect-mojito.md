<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is the origin of mojito?</h3>

<h3>What type of rum is used in mojito?</h3>
<p>White rum is traditionally used in mojito, as it has a mild flavor that doesn't overpower the other ingredients. However, you can use any type of rum you like, depending on your preference.</p>

<h3>Can I make a non-alcoholic version of mojito?</h3>

<h3>What is the best way to muddle the mint leaves?</h3>
<p>You can use a muddler or a wooden spoon to muddle the mint leaves. Gently press the leaves against the bottom of the glass or shaker until they release their oils, but be careful not to over-muddle them, as this can make the cocktail bitter.</p>

<h3>How do I know if the sugar is dissolved?</h3>

<h3>Can I make mojito in advance?</h3>

<h3>Can I use sparkling water instead of soda water?</h3>

<h3>What are the calories in mojito?</h3>

<h3>Can I make mojito without mint leaves?</h3>

<h3>Can I use brown sugar instead of white sugar?</h3>
