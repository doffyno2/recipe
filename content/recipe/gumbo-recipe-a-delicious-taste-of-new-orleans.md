<p>Now that you have all the ingredients and tools you need, here's how to make gumbo:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Begin by marinating the chicken. In a bowl, combine the vegetable oil, white wine vinegar, salt, black pepper, paprika, and dried thyme. Add the cubed chicken breast and stir well to coat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</li>
    <li>Heat the vegetable oil in the large pot over medium-high heat. Add the Andouille sausage and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the sausage from the pot and set it aside on a plate.</li>
    <li>Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside on the plate with the sausage.</li>
    <li>Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, and celery to the pot and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir well. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until the flour turns a golden brown color.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken broth, one cup at a time, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let the gumbo simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the browned sausage and chicken back to the pot, along with the peeled and deveined shrimp. Stir well and let the gumbo simmer for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the chopped parsley, green onions, salt, black pepper, paprika, dried thyme, file powder, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce (if using). Stir well and let the gumbo simmer for a final 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for 5-10 minutes to cool slightly. Serve the gumbo over cooked rice.</li>

<p>Now that you know how to make gumbo, here are some tips on how to cook it:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Make sure you're using a large enough pot to accommodate all the ingredients. Gumbo is a stew, so it needs space to simmer and reduce.</li>
    <li>Stir the gumbo frequently to avoid sticking and burning. This is especially important when adding the flour to the pot.</li>
