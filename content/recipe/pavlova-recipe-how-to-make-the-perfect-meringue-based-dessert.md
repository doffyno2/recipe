<li>Turn off the oven and leave the pavlova inside to cool completely.</li>
<li>Once the pavlova has cooled, carefully transfer it to a serving platter using a spatula.</li>
<li>Spread the whipped cream on top of the pavlova, filling the indentation in the center.</li>
<li>Top with the marinated fruit and serve immediately.</li>

<p>While pavlova is technically baked in the oven, it's important to note that it's not really "cooked" per se. Because pavlova is made from a meringue mixture, it's important to bake it at a low temperature so that it dries out and becomes crisp on the outside while remaining soft and marshmallowy on the inside.</p>

<h3>1. Can I use regular granulated sugar instead of superfine sugar?</h3>

<p>While superfine sugar is preferable because it dissolves more quickly, you can use regular granulated sugar if you don't have superfine sugar on hand. Simply process the granulated sugar in a food processor for a few seconds until it becomes finer.</p>

<h3>2. Can I make pavlova ahead of time?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can make pavlova ahead of time, but it's best to assemble it just before serving. Store the cooled pavlova in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the fridge for up to 1 week.</p>

<h3>3. Can I freeze pavlova?</h3>

<p>No, pavlova does not freeze well as the meringue can become soggy and lose its texture when thawed.</p>

<h3>4. Can I use other fruits instead of strawberries, kiwi, and passionfruit?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can use any combination of fresh fruit that you like. Just make sure to cut the fruit into small pieces so that it's easy to eat on top of the pavlova.</p>

<h3>5. Can I add other flavors to the pavlova?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can add other flavors to the pavlova such as cocoa powder, almond extract, or citrus zest. Just be sure to add them in small amounts so that they don't affect the texture of the meringue.</p>
