<p>Now that you have all the ingredients and tools ready, it's time to start making your lemon meringue pie.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the crust</h3>

<p>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the ice water and mix until the dough comes together. Shape the dough into a disc, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Roll out the crust</h3>

<p>Preheat your oven to 375Â°F. On a floured surface, roll out the dough to fit your pie dish. Transfer the dough to the dish and trim the edges. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork and bake for 12-15 minutes or until lightly golden. Set aside to cool.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Make the filling</h3>

<p>In a saucepan, combine the sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Gradually stir in the water, then add the egg yolks and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in the butter and lemon zest. Pour the filling into the cooled crust.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Make the meringue</h3>

<p>In a mixing bowl, beat the egg whites with cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Spoon the meringue over the filling, making sure to seal the edges.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Bake and cool</h3>

<p>Bake the pie for 12-15 minutes or until the meringue is lightly golden. Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving.</p>
