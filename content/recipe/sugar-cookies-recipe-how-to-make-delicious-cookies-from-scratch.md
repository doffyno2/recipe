<p>Before you start making the cookie dough, it's important to marinade it for at least 30 minutes. Here's how to do it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
  <li>In a separate bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
  <li>Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
  <li>Add the flour mixture gradually, stirring until just combined.</li>
  <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Marinading the dough helps it to firm up and makes it easier to roll out and cut into shapes.</p>
