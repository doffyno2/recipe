<h2>How to Make Pierogi Recipe</h2>

Follow these steps to make delicious pierogi:

<ol>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the egg and lukewarm water. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
<li>On a floured surface, knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>In a skillet, melt the butter and sauté the onion and garlic until they become soft and fragrant. Add the ground pork and cook until browned. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>In a medium-sized bowl, mix the mashed potatoes and grated cheddar cheese until well combined.</li>
<li>In another medium-sized bowl, mix the sauerkraut with a tablespoon of butter.</li>
<li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1/8 inch thickness. Use a 3-inch round cookie cutter to cut out circles of dough.</li>
<li>Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough in half and pinch the edges together to seal the pierogi. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.</li>
<li>In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the pierogi in batches for about 3-5 minutes or until they float to the surface. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pierogi from the pot and place them in a colander to drain.</li>
<li>In a skillet, melt a tablespoon of butter and sauté the pierogi until they become golden brown on both sides.</li>
