<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p>Here are some frequently asked questions about Dutch babies:</p>

<h3>1. Can I make Dutch babies ahead of time?</h3>
<p>It's best to serve Dutch babies fresh out of the oven as they tend to deflate quickly. However, you can make the batter ahead of time and store it in the fridge for up to 12 hours. Just give the batter a quick stir before using it.</p>

<h3>2. Can I use a different type of flour?</h3>
<p>All-purpose flour works best for Dutch babies, but you can use whole wheat flour or gluten-free flour if you prefer. Keep in mind that the texture and taste may differ slightly.</p>

<h3>3. Can I make savory Dutch babies?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can! Simply omit the sugar and vanilla extract from the batter and add savory toppings such as cheese, ham, vegetables, or herbs. You can also serve the savory Dutch baby with a side salad or soup.</p>

<h3>4. Can I use a different type of pan?</h3>
<p>A cast-iron skillet or oven-safe pan is recommended for making Dutch babies as it ensures even cooking and a crispy crust. However, you can use a regular skillet or baking dish if you don't have a cast-iron skillet. Just make sure to preheat the pan in the oven before adding the batter.</p>
