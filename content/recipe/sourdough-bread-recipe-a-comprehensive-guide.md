<ul>
  <li>3 cups of bread flour</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups of water</li>
  <li>1/4 cup of sourdough starter</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Before making the sourdough bread, you will need to prepare the marinade. This will help to activate the natural yeast in the sourdough starter and create the perfect environment for fermentation. To make the marinade, mix the following ingredients in a bowl:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
  <li>1/4 cup of sourdough starter</li>
  <li>1/2 cup of bread flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the mixture until it forms a thick paste, then cover it with a clean cloth and let it rest for 6-8 hours at room temperature. This will allow the natural yeast to feed on the flour and water, creating a bubbly and active marinade.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread flour, salt, and marinade.</li>
  <li>Mix the ingredients with a wooden spoon or spatula until they form a shaggy dough.</li>
  <li>Use your hands to knead the dough for 5-10 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
  <li>Cover the dough with a clean cloth and let it rest for 2-3 hours at room temperature.</li>
  <li>After the resting period, use a dough scraper to shape the dough into a ball and place it in a bread proofing basket.</li>
  <li>Cover the basket with a clean cloth and let the dough rise for another 2-3 hours.</li>
  <li>Preheat your baking stone or Dutch oven in the oven at 450°F (230°C) for 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Carefully transfer the dough from the proofing basket onto the baking stone or Dutch oven.</li>
  <li>Bake the bread for 30-35 minutes, until it becomes golden brown and crusty.</li>
  <li>Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing and serving.</li>

<h3>1. What is sourdough bread?</h3>
<p>Sourdough bread is a type of bread made using natural fermentation, which involves the use of naturally occurring yeast and bacteria to leaven the dough. This gives the bread a unique flavor and texture, as well as making it easier to digest.</p>

<h3>2. How do you make sourdough starter?</h3>
<p>To make sourdough starter, mix equal parts of flour and water in a jar and let it sit at room temperature for several days, stirring it daily. The mixture will start to ferment and develop bubbles, indicating that the natural yeast and bacteria are active. Once the starter is bubbly and smells sour, it's ready to use in the bread recipe.</p>

<h3>3. Can you make sourdough bread without a bread proofing basket?</h3>
<p>While a bread proofing basket is recommended for shaping and proofing the dough, you can use a regular bowl lined with a clean cloth instead. Just make sure to dust the cloth with flour to prevent the dough from sticking.</p>

<h3>4. Can you freeze sourdough bread?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can freeze sourdough bread for up to 3 months. To freeze, wrap the bread tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store it in the freezer. To thaw, let the bread sit at room temperature for a few hours or overnight.</p>

<h3>5. How do you know when sourdough bread is done?</h3>
<p>Sourdough bread is done when it has a golden brown crust and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. You can also use a thermometer to check the internal temperature, which should be around 200°F (93°C).</p>

<h3>6. Can you make sourdough bread with whole wheat flour?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can substitute part or all of the bread flour with whole wheat flour to make sourdough bread. However, keep in mind that whole wheat flour may require more water and longer fermentation time than bread flour.</p>

<h3>7. How do you store sourdough bread?</h3>
<p>To keep sourdough bread fresh, store it in a paper bag or bread box at room temperature for up to 3 days. You can also wrap it in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store it in the fridge for up to a week.</p>

<h3>8. Can you use sourdough starter in other recipes?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can use sourdough starter in a variety of recipes, such as pancakes, waffles, and pizza dough, to add flavor and nutrition. Just make sure to adjust the recipe accordingly and use a mature and active starter.</p>

<h3>9. How do you revive a dormant sourdough starter?</h3>
<p>If your sourdough starter has been neglected or stored in the fridge for a long time, it may become dormant or inactive. To revive it, feed it with equal parts of flour and water and let it sit at room temperature for a few days, stirring it daily. Once it becomes bubbly and active again, it's ready to use.</p>

<h3>10. Can you make sourdough bread in a bread machine?</h3>
<p>While it's possible to make sourdough bread in a bread machine, it's not recommended as the machine may not provide the necessary conditions for natural fermentation and crust development. It's best to make sourdough bread by hand or using a stand mixer.</p>
