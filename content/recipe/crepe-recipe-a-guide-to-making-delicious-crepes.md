<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
</ul>

<p>These ingredients will yield about 8-10 crepes, depending on the size of your pan. </p>

<h2>For the Marinade Crepe Recipe</h2>

<p>There is no marinade required for making crepes. However, you can add different flavors to the batter to enhance the taste of your crepes. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add a tablespoon of sugar to the batter if you plan to have sweet crepes.</li>
    <li>Add a teaspoon of vanilla extract for a subtle vanilla flavor.</li>
    <li>Add a tablespoon of cocoa powder for chocolate crepes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Kitchen Tools Needed for Crepe Recipe</h2>

<p>To make perfect crepes, you will need the following tools:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A non-stick crepe pan or a non-stick skillet with a flat bottom</li>
    <li>A whisk or a blender to mix the batter</li>
    <li>A ladle or a measuring cup to pour the batter onto the pan</li>
    <li>A spatula to flip the crepes</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Make Crepe Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have all the ingredients and tools ready, let's get started with making the batter:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour and salt.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until smooth. </li>
    <li>Add the milk, water, and melted butter to the eggs and whisk until well combined. </li>
    <li>Sift the flour mixture into the egg mixture and whisk until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. </li>
    <li>Cover the batter and let it rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax and the batter to thicken. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that the batter is ready, it's time to start making the crepes:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Heat the crepe pan over medium-high heat. </li>
    <li>Use a ladle or a measuring cup to pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the center of the pan. </li>
    <li>Tilt the pan in a circular motion to spread the batter evenly. </li>
    <li>Cook the crepe for about 30 seconds or until the edges start to lift from the pan. </li>
    <li>Flip the crepe over using a spatula and cook for another 10 seconds. </li>
    <li>Transfer the crepe onto a plate and repeat the process with the remaining batter. </li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have made all the crepes, it's time to fill them with your desired filling. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fruit and cream: Fill the crepes with whipped cream and fresh fruits like strawberries, blueberries, and bananas.</li>
    <li>Nutella and banana: Spread Nutella on the crepes and add slices of bananas.</li>
    <li>Ham and cheese: Place slices of ham and cheese on the crepes and fold them into triangles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Cook Crepe Recipe</h2>

    <li>Make sure the batter is smooth and free of lumps. </li>
    <li>Do not overfill the pan with batter. A thin layer is all you need. </li>
