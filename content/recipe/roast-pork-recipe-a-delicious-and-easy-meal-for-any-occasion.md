<h2>Ingredients Needed to Make Roast Pork Recipe</h2>

<p>Before you start cooking, you’ll need to gather all the necessary ingredients. Here’s what you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 boneless pork loin (about 3-4 pounds)</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
  <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you have all these ingredients on hand before starting the recipe to avoid any last-minute trips to the grocery store.</p>

<h2>For the Marinade Roast Pork Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have all of your ingredients, it’s time to prepare the marinade. Here’s how:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, dried thyme, dried rosemary, paprika, and cayenne pepper.</li>
  <li>Rub the mixture all over the pork loin, making sure to coat it evenly.</li>
  <li>Place the pork loin in a large resealable plastic bag and pour in the chicken broth.</li>
  <li>Seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
</ol>

<p>Allowing the pork to marinate for an extended period will result in a more flavorful and juicy roast pork. So, if possible, marinate the pork overnight for best results.</p>
