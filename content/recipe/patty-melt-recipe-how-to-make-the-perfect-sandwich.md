<li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

<h2>For the Marinade Patty Melt Recipe</h2>

To add some flavor to your patty melt, you can create a simple marinade with the following ingredients:

<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
<li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

<h2>Kitchen Tools Needed Patty Melt Recipe</h2>

To make a patty melt, you'll need the following kitchen tools:

<ul>
<li>A large skillet</li>
<li>A spatula</li>
<li>A cutting board</li>
<li>A sharp knife</li>
<li>A bowl for the marinade (if using)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Make Patty Melt Recipe</h2>

Now that you have all of your ingredients and tools, it's time to start making your patty melt. Follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Preheat your skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
<li>While your skillet is heating up, shape your ground beef into four patties, about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
<li>If using the marinade, place your patties in the marinade bowl and let them sit for at least 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Once your skillet is hot, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter.</li>
<li>Add your sliced onions to the skillet and cook them until they are caramelized, about 10-15 minutes. Remove them from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
<li>Add your beef patties to the skillet and cook them for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
<li>Once your patties are cooked, remove them from the skillet and set them aside.</li>
<li>Assemble your sandwich by placing a slice of Swiss cheese on top of each slice of bread.</li>
<li>Place your beef patty on one slice of bread and top it with your caramelized onions.</li>
<li>Top your sandwich with the other slice of bread, cheese side down.</li>
<li>Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in the skillet over medium heat.</li>
<li>Place your assembled sandwich in the skillet and cook it for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the bread is toasted and the cheese is melted.</li>
<li>Remove your sandwich from the skillet and serve it hot.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to Cook Patty Melt Recipe</h2>

Cooking the perfect patty melt requires a bit of patience and attention to detail. Here are some tips to help you cook your patty melt to perfection:

<ul>
<li>Make sure your skillet is hot before adding your patties. This will ensure that they cook evenly and don't stick to the pan.</li>
<li>Don't press down on your patties while they're cooking. This can cause them to lose their juices and become dry.</li>
<li>When toasting your bread, use a little bit of butter or oil to help it crisp up and develop a golden brown color.</li>
<li>Don't rush the cooking process. Give your patties and onions enough time to cook properly and develop flavor.</li>
</ul>
