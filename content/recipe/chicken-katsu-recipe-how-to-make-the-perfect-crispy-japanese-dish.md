<h2>How to Make Chicken Katsu Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that you have all the ingredients and tools you need, let's get started on making chicken katsu:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, prepare the marinade. In a ziplock bag, mix together the soy sauce, sake, mirin, garlic, and ginger.</li>
  <li>Place the chicken breasts in the bag with the marinade and seal it. Marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or overnight if possible.</li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
  <li>Take the chicken out of the marinade and place it on the baking sheet. Discard the marinade.</li>
  <li>Using a meat tenderizer, pound the chicken until it's about 1/4-inch thick.</li>
  <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
  <li>Place the flour in a shallow bowl, the beaten eggs in another shallow bowl, and the panko breadcrumbs in a third shallow bowl.</li>
  <li>Dredge the chicken in the flour, shaking off any excess. Then dip it in the beaten eggs, and coat it in the panko breadcrumbs.</li>
  <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.</li>
  <li>Once the oil is hot, carefully place the chicken in the pan and fry for about 4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
  <li>Transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack to drain off any excess oil.</li>
  <li>Place the chicken on the prepared baking sheet and bake in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until cooked through.</li>
  <li>Serve the chicken katsu with a side of rice and tonkatsu sauce (a sweet and tangy sauce typically served with Japanese fried foods).</li>

<h2>How to Cook Chicken Katsu Recipe</h2>

<p>The key to cooking chicken katsu is to make sure it's crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Here are a few tips to help you cook the perfect chicken katsu:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure the oil is hot enough before frying the chicken. If the oil is not hot enough, the chicken will absorb too much oil and become greasy.</li>
  <li>Don't overcrowd the pan when frying the chicken. This will cause the temperature of the oil to drop, resulting in unevenly cooked chicken.</li>
  <li>Use a wire rack to drain off any excess oil after frying the chicken. This will help keep the chicken crispy.</li>
  <li>Bake the chicken in the oven to ensure it's cooked through. This will also help keep the chicken crispy.</li>
</ul>
