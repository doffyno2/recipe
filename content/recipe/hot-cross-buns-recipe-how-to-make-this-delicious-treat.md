<h2>How to Make Hot Cross Buns Recipe</h2>

<p>Now that we have everything ready, let's start making our hot cross buns:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, yeast, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Make a well in the center of the mixture and add the warm milk, melted butter, and egg. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Add the raisins or currants and the mixed candied peel to the dough. Knead the dough for 5-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a greased mixing bowl and cover it with a damp cloth. Leave it to rise for 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.</li>
    <li>Punch the dough down and knead it again for a few minutes. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions and shape them into buns.</li>
    <li>Place the buns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover them with a damp cloth and leave them to rise for another 30-40 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Mix the water and sugar in a small bowl to make the marinade.</li>
    <li>Using a pastry brush, brush the marinade over the buns, making sure to cover the tops and sides. Bake the buns in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes until they are golden brown.</li>
    <li>Remove the buns from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack. Once they have cooled, use a piping bag or a ziplock bag with a corner cut off to pipe crosses on the top of the buns using icing.</li>
    <li>Enjoy your delicious hot cross buns!</li>
