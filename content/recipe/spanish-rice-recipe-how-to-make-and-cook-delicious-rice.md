Now that you have all of the necessary ingredients and tools, it's time to make the perfect Spanish rice recipe. Follow these simple steps:

<ol>
  <li>Start by making the marinade. In a small bowl, whisk together the orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Set aside.</li>
  <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and saut√© until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add the rice to the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly golden brown, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add the red and green bell peppers and continue cooking for an additional 2-3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add the diced tomatoes, chicken broth, chili powder, cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir to combine.</li>
  <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the skillet. Simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed.</li>
  <li>Once the rice is cooked, stir in the marinade and cilantro. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>

  <li>Use chicken broth instead of water for added flavor.</li>
  <li>Simmer the rice on low heat with the lid on to prevent steam from escaping.</li>
  <li>Do not stir the rice while it's cooking. This will cause it to become mushy.</li>
