<p>Cooking paella requires some special techniques to ensure that the rice cooks evenly and absorbs all the flavors. Here are some tips to help you cook paella:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use short-grain rice, such as Arborio or Valencia rice. These rice varieties absorb more liquid and have a creamy texture.</li>
  <li>Spread the rice evenly in the pan and avoid stirring it too much. This will help the rice cook evenly and form a crispy crust at the bottom of the pan (socarrat).</li>
  <li>Use high-quality saffron threads for the best flavor and color.</li>
  <li>Let the paella rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
</ul>
